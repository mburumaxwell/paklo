description: Run Dependabot on Azure DevOps repositories with the extension, CLI, or hosted service.
---

Paklo brings automated dependency updates to Azure DevOps repositories using Dependabot. Choose the deployment method that best fits your needs:

## Deployment Options

### Azure DevOps Extension

Run Dependabot in your Azure Pipelines with full control over scheduling and configuration.

**Best for:** Teams who want to manage updates in their existing pipeline infrastructure.

[Learn more →](/docs/extensions/azure)

### CLI

Run Dependabot locally or in any CI/CD environment with Docker support.

**Best for:** Local testing, custom automation, or non-Azure DevOps CI/CD systems.

[Learn more →](/docs/cli)

### Hosted Service

Fully managed Dependabot updates without infrastructure management.

**Best for:** Teams who want automatic updates without pipeline configuration or maintenance.

## Quick Start: Azure DevOps Extension

1. Install the [Dependabot extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tingle-software.dependabot) from the Visual Studio Marketplace.

2. Create a `dependabot.yml` file at `.github/dependabot.yml` or `.azuredevops/dependabot.yml`:

   ```yaml
   version: 2
   updates:
     - package-ecosystem: 'npm'
       directory: '/'
       schedule:
         interval: 'weekly'
   ```

3. Create a pipeline with the `dependabot@2` task:

   ```yaml
   trigger: none # Disable CI trigger

   schedules:
     - cron: '0 0 * * 0' # Weekly on Sunday at midnight UTC
       always: true
       branches:
         include:
           - main
       batch: true
       displayName: Weekly Dependabot

   pool:
     vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest' # Requires macOS or Ubuntu (Windows not supported)

   steps:
     - task: dependabot@2
       inputs:
         mergeStrategy: 'squash'
   ```

The task accepts many inputs such as `dryRun`, `setAutoComplete`, and `mergeStrategy`. See [Azure DevOps Extension](/docs/extensions/azure) for the full list.

## Configuration

All deployment methods use the same `dependabot.yml` configuration format. See [Configuration](/docs/configuration) for complete documentation.
